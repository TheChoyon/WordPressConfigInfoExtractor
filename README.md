A handy script designed to collect all the MySQL db name, username, password, host from a collection of config files.<br>

Usage:

It's too simple to use!<br>
Create a folder named <b>conf</b> and put all the wordpress config files in it. Make sure the conf folder is in the same folder where the script is! that means, create a folder, put this script in that folder. Now create another folder inside the this folder named <b>conf</b>. Confused? lol.<br>
Now simply run the script and your job is done! Check <b>Extracted.txt</b> file for extracted data!
